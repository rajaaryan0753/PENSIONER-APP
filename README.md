<strong> Java Application </strong>
<p>
This Project was developed as a part of summer internship at IT Department of Mormugao Port Trust(Goa).
</p>
<h4>Details of Project</h4>
<p>
Basically this is a Graphic User Interface(GUI) Application which prints the Pensioner identity Card of retired employee of the organisation.This  GUI application was created with Eclipse IDE(Integrated development  Environment)using swing framework.</p>
<p>
For the testing purpose we have stored data in Excel sheet (as the original data given by the organization was in excel sheet)But this can work also with ease by MYSQL database with slight modification in the path of Input.
 </p>
 <h4>How it works? </h4>
 <p>
 Basically It takes Id number of employee as one of the input or either you can manually enter the employee details and  in the next step it fetches the data stored in the excel file.Also Before printing the identity card it gives access to the  operator to edit the phone,Address and recent photograph of the employee
